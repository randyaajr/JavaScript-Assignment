# JavaScript Assignment
-----------------------

## Project Discription
*This assignment demonstrats my skills using HTML form elements and JavaScript topics such as: Functions, parsing the DOM, form validation, conditional statements, debugging methods, formulas and Math Object.*

### Assingment Requirements
 * Create two simple html pages
   - [x] index.html contains an HTML form that needs to be validated by JavaScript when submitted.
   - [x] excel.html contains a simple form to let the user enter their numeric values then you will use
         excel four common functions to find: the average, maximum, minimum, and total.
 * Create an external JavaScript file: script.js
   - [x] The file should be placed inside a sub-folder named “js”.
   - [x] All your code must be placed in this file
   - [x] The file must be linked to the two html files
 * Create an external Style Sheet file: styles.css
   - [x] The file should be placed inside a sub-folder named “css”.
   - [x] All your CSS rules must be placed in this file.
   - [x] The file must be linked to the two html files.
   - [x] You can use any CSS rules you like to style your 2 HTML pages but remember that this
         assignment is mainly about JavaScript, so it’s better to finish the assignment requirements first
         then add the styles later.
 * The two HTML files, JS file, CSS file, plus the two subfolders have to be inside the assignment main
   folder named: “JS-Assignment-YourFirstName”
   e.g: JS-Assignment-Martin
